# PS Bank

> Starter template for a Banking Website built on Django, designed with Bootstrap 4.

## Installation:

**1. Fork the Repo**

Fork this repository!

**2. Setup Virtual Environment & Install Requirements**

Create and activate your preferred virtual environment within the workspace, then run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you encounter issues with this stage of the process, speak to your instructors for assistance.

**3. Explore the Code**

Begin familiarizing yourself with the codebase. Using your code editor's search feature, view all of the TODO comments.

**4. Run Server?**

When you're ready to run the application, use the following command.

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

Depending on the state of the application, you may (and probably will) encounter errors! These errors can be helpful in determining what you should do next within the application, but don't let them confuse you. The TODOs will naturally guide your progress.

**5. Start Coding**

Once you're ready, pick a place to begin and start coding! The list of tasks in front of you might be daunting, but they shall fall one by one.

Remember to test your progress periodically, and ensure everything works the way you would expect a banking application to.
